Pixel values are somewhat arbitrary.\\
A negative value could just be a low value.\\
What is important is the range of acceptable \\
pixel values, for example, you could have an\\
image where -10 is black and 10 is white.\\
Or you could have an image where 0 is black \\
and 20 is white.  It's important to keep \\
negative pixel values because if we force \\
them to be 0, we may lose information.
