With a higher sigma, the blue channel image looked\\
better.  With a lower sigma, the green channel\\
image looked better.  I think that this is because\\
of the grass in the background.  A higher sigma\\
would make the green channel image look more washed\\
out wheras this wasn't the case if the sigma was\\
lower.  For my image, (int) a sigma of 20 seemed\\
to get noticeable noise outside of the darker\\
areas.  However, even a very low sigma in my image\\
would have shown noise clearly in the darker areas.
