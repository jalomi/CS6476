I think green does.  In my opinion,\\
the details feel closest to the origional\\
image in the green channel.  The red one\\
looks a bit more washed out.  While not\\
apperent, at least to me, in the flag image,\\
after additional testing, the blue channel,\\
looks dimmer.  Again, I'd say the green\\
channel image feels like it's maintaining\\
more detail than the other 2.  After some\\
research, I found that our eyes have evolved\\
to be less sensitive to blue light and to\\
see green light the brightest.  This certainly\\
explains the results of this experiment!
